		//how many items this current slot has and if you add this new item quantity, how many items you will have.
		//If it's greater than 50, you should make the quantity of one slot 50 and add the remainder quantity to a new slot.
		//For example:
		//[ HP 48 ] [  ] [  ] [  ] [  ] Inventory has a HP(healing potions) with 48 as quantity and you want to add more 5 HP
		//[ HP 50 ] [HP 3] [  ] [  ] [  ] Inventory after you added 5 HP

		//Use the method IsFullForItem;

		//If after you insert the item your inventory becomes full for the remainder, Print a message to the user with how many
		//items will be discarted;
