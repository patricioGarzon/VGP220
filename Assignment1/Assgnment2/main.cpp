//How much time does the following method take? Use the big-O notation in terms
//of the parameter n.

//TODO: This question is optional. It's bonus if you don't search or copy anything from the internet.
//There are no wrong answers. Interview questions like this one is just to evaluate how you think.
//Of course that you can find this question on the internet, but try not to. Think about what is the worst case scenario.
//and how can you make this better.

//Question 6: EA's and Google's Interview question

//You work in a 100 floor building and you get 2 identical eggs. 
//You need to figure out the highest floor an egg can be dropped without breaking. 
//Find an algorithm that is minimizing number of throws in the worst-case scenario.
//Code is not necessary. You can explain with your own words.
//You can make some assumptions like:
//1)If an egg doesn’t break when dropped from some floor, then it will not break when dropped from any lower floors.
//2)An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
//3)A broken egg must be discarded.
//4)The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
//5)If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.

/* Answer
* we calculate in halfs, 50 - 25 -12 to see where it does not break
* we save the two values (initial and end) so when the egg survives we can calculate the half between the two 
* floors it did not break. until we reach the flor which will not break
